# Level Mapper

In game development, leveling up is a core feature that not only marks progression but also enriches the player's experience by offering tangible rewards and new challenges. The Level Mapper is a versatile tool designed for customizing the upgrade paths of objects within your game. This can include example use-cases like:

* **Weapon evolution**: Weapons can evolve or be upgraded as players collect certain materials or reach particular benchmarks&#x20;
* **Building upgrades**:  to unlock new features or improve their efficiency (upgrading a farm may increase food production rates or a barracks might allow for the training of more advanced units.)
* **Character Progression:** Accumulating enough XP results in the character gaining a level, which might increase the character's stats (like health, strength, agility) and unlock new abilities or skills.

By utilizing the Level Mapper, developers can set clear, trackable goals for players, encouraging engagement and offering rewarding gameplay experiences as they watch their in-game assets grow and evolve.
