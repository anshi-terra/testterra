## Selecting an Asset

Clicking on any asset in the game workspace selects it. A list of Asset properties is then displayed in the Inspector Panel, you can change the properties of the asset from the inspector panel as well.

## Transformation of an Asset

You can do three basic transformations, after selecting any asset - `Move` , `Rotate` and `Scale`. When an object is selected 3 handles will appear around it, each representing an axis along which you can manipulate the object.&#x20;
