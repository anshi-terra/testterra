# About Behaviour Templates

## What is a behaviour template?

A “template” is a logic block inside T-Studio, which helps designers achieve a specific action or desired output of a game, without coding it. A game designer can simply drag a template onto a 3D object and set it up for the behaviour they want.&#x20;

Each template also has a series of parameters attached to it, which you can customise according to your game design.

## How can I add a template?

You can add a template to any object using the following steps, in sequence:&#x20;

* Select the object by clicking on the object, either in the workspace or on the [`Layers Panel`](../editor-essentials/builder-menu-and-builder-panel/layers.md)
* Click on **`Add Behaviour`** in the [`Inspector Panel`](../editor-essentials/inspector-panel.md) on the right to open up a list of all available templates&#x20;
* Select the relevant template and Click **`Done`**.&#x20;
* You can now scroll down the [`Inspector Panel`](../editor-essentials/inspector-panel.md) to find the added templates and all its customizable parameters
